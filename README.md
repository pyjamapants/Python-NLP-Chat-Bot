# Python-NLP-Chat-Bot
This is a python flask based Nlp API created for a help desk based chat bot. 
Complaints are registered into Mongo DB and a ticket number is generated whenever someone registers a complaint. 
This bot would understand issues related to an office space, for example an issue related to air conditioner, chairs, tables, lights etc.
May such bots could be built based on specific use cases.
